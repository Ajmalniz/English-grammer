## Part C: Reading Comprehension (6 questions)

**Read the following passage and answer questions 22-27:**

"Effective study techniques are essential for academic success. One important technique is active learning, which involves engaging with the material rather than passively reading. This includes taking notes, asking questions, and summarizing key points. Another crucial technique is spaced repetition, where you review material at increasing intervals.
